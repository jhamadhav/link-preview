        <div class="heading">What is it ?</div>
        <p>It's called a <a href="https://github.com/jhamadhav/link-preview">link Preview</a>, what it intends to do is
            show the user the content of the link
            he/she is about
            to click.The reviews feature solves the core problem of users needing to open multiple tabs to gain an
            understanding of a word or concept within the context of the subject they are reading. <br> <br>
            With link previews,
            whenever a reader hovers over a link to another page, a short summary of the subject and an image (if
            available) is displayed. The user can then decide whether they wish to visit that page more thoroughly
            before continuing. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab">
        <div class="heading">How to use it ?</div>
        <p>To test it out, Paste any link that you wish to see in the <a href="#main-h">search bar</a> above
            and <i>Voila</i> you
            have your preview.
            <br><br>
            Want to have it as a extension in your browser, follow along : <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Visit the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox addon</a> page or <a
                    href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions">Chrome store</a> for chrome users.
            </li>
            <li>Search for link preview in the search bar.</li>
            <li>Found it ! Click on add it to your browser, give all the permission</li>
            <li>And you have your own link previewer ready !</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab">
        <div class="heading">So how does it work again ?</div>
        <p>We talked above about what it does lets know about how it works, i.e. the coding behind it. <br> Let's dive
            into it : <br>

            <!-- step 1 -->
        <div class="step">Step 1 :</div>
        <span>First comes the HTML part of the previewer, it includes a title, description, url and a image. All this is
            contained in a external div. <br> <br> The code is as follows : <br>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhamadhav/1662497adf3fe6af9aab887e3d8d3e9a.js"></script>
        </span>

        <!-- step 2 -->
        <div class="step">Step 2 :</div>
        <span>Next is the styling of the viewer.. lets skip that for now as it's all just basics <br> <br> The code is
            as follows : <br>
            <a href="https://gist.github.com/jhamadhav/52381bcc703a0c849b4fbe8b8af8e318">link-preview.scc</a>
        </span>
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="tab">
        <div class="heading">Client side code : </div>
        <p>
            <!-- step 3 -->
        <div class="step">Step 3 :</div>
        <span>Now lets come to the logic part, When the user hovers over a link i.e an anchor tag (mostly), an event
            listener is added to the anchor tags that captures the url that it points to and sends it to another
            function. <br> <br> The code
            is
            as follows :
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhamadhav/8a32acd298a5d1a615691499dbbb9990.js"></script>
        </span>

        <!-- step 4 -->
        <div class="step">Step 4 :</div>
        <span>The data about the targeted link is fetched from a database, thus it is a async function i.e. it may take
            some time for the data to come till then show loading text. <br>Once done check if the link has already been
            fetched and stored in an array called <b>links</b>. If it exists then don't send a request to the database
            else send a fetch request. <br> <br> The code
            is
            as follows :
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhamadhav/fe7f492a0345ed2df76e9218ec02a1cc.js"></script>
        </span>

        <!-- step 5 -->
        <div class="step">Step 5 :</div>
        <span>Once the data has been fetched from the database or has been found in the local variable, fill the dom
            elements that we created earlier with it <br> <br> The code
            is
            as follows :
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhamadhav/b53f674df09c28f8b73054229d7cfdcc.js"></script>
        </span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab">
        <div class="heading">Server side code</div>
        <p>
            <!-- step 6 -->
        <div class="step">Step 6 :</div>
        <span>Once the url is received by the server, it checks if the url is actually a correct url and if it is it
            queries the database for it and if it comes undefined then scrape the pointed url for the meta tags to look
            for the data we need. <br> <br> The code
            is
            as follows :
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jhamadhav/99def696fd10c7435bcd87f631f951f0.js"></script>
        </span> <br> <br>
        The scraper code logic is not explained here as it has been explained very well by many other articles one such
        is this one from the <a
